AI agents are revolutionizing how we build software. In this post, we'll explore what AI agents are and how you can start using them in your projects.

## What Are AI Agents?

An AI agent is a software program that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional programs that follow fixed rules, AI agents can:

- **Learn** from their experiences
- **Adapt** to new situations
- **Make decisions** in uncertain environments
- **Interact** with users and other systems

AI agents are not just chatbots. They can browse the web, write code, manage files, and interact with APIs autonomously.
</Callout>

## The Agent Architecture

A typical AI agent consists of several components:

```typescript
interface AIAgent {
  // Core components
  model: LLM;              // The language model brain
  memory: Memory;          // Short and long-term memory
  tools: Tool[];           // Actions the agent can take
  planner: Planner;        // Decision-making logic
  
  // Lifecycle methods
  perceive(input: string): void;
  think(): Action;
  act(action: Action): Result;
  reflect(result: Result): void;
}
```

## Building Your First Agent

Here's a simple example of an AI agent using TypeScript:

```typescript
class SimpleAgent {
  private llm: LanguageModel;
  private tools: Map<string, Tool>;
  
  constructor(llm: LanguageModel) {
    this.llm = llm;
    this.tools = new Map();
  }
  
  async run(task: string): Promise<string> {
    // 1. Understand the task
    const plan = await this.llm.plan(task);
    
    // 2. Execute each step
    for (const step of plan.steps) {
      const tool = this.tools.get(step.toolName);
      if (tool) {
        const result = await tool.execute(step.params);
        // Use result for next step
      }
    }
    
    // 3. Return final response
    return this.llm.summarize(plan.results);
  }
}
```

## Real-World Applications

AI agents are being used in:

1. **Code Generation** - Writing and refactoring code
2. **Research** - Gathering and synthesizing information
3. **Customer Support** - Handling complex queries
4. **Data Analysis** - Processing and visualizing data
5. **Automation** - Workflow automation and task execution

<Callout type="warning" title="Important Consideration">
Always implement proper guardrails and safety measures when deploying AI agents in production. They can make mistakes and should be monitored.
</Callout>

## The Future of AI Agents

As language models improve, we'll see agents that can:

- Work autonomously for extended periods
- Collaborate with other agents
- Learn from human feedback in real-time
- Handle increasingly complex tasks
